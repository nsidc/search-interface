## Git workflow

Development on this project uses
[the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html):

1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
2. Stage your changes (`git add`)
3. Commit your JSHint-compliant and test-passing changes (just run `grunt`) with a
   [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   (`git commit`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push -u origin my-new-feature`)
5. [Create a new Pull Request](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/set-search-services/pull-request/new)

## NSIDC Continuous Integration

NSIDC's project CI utilizes internal configuration found in the *.yaml, Vagrantfile
and /puppet/*.   If you are utilizing this project external to NSIDC
you can safely ignore those files and the remainder of this section.

Most projects just have a file called `vagrant-nsidc.yaml`, which specifies a
`project` name for the plugin to use. This repository really has two projects,
`ade_search` and `nsidc_search`, configured in `vagrant-nsidc.ade_search.yaml`
and `vagrant-nsidc.nsidc_search.yaml`.

To use the correct config file, set the appropriate environment variable:

```shell
export VAGRANT_NSIDC_YAML=vagrant-nsidc.ade_search.yaml
```

If switching which project you are working on, take care that you are using the
correct config file, and that the temp file `.nsidc-project.yaml` references the
right project.

Once that is setup, machines can be provisied as expected using the vagrant-nsidc
plugin.

## Grunt

Run `grunt tasks` to get a list and descriptions of the most important grunt
tasks defined in `Gruntfile.js`. Tasks that should use additional command line
flags list those flags at the end of the description.

The default grunt task (i.e., just running `grunt`) runs syntax checkers and
unit tests.

`grunt tasks` does not list `grunt watch` tasks, and there are a couple of those
that are useful:

* `grunt watch:lint-test` will automatically run JSHint, scss-lint, and the
  Jasmine test suite whenever a JavaScript or Sass file is changed
* `grunt watch:build-$PROJECT` automatically runs `grunt build:$PROJECT-dev`
  whenever a Sass or Jade file is changed (`PROJECT` must be `acadis` or
  `nsidc`)

## Build

`grunt build:nsidc` and `grunt build:acadis` will create a `build/` directory
containing HTML and CSS files generated from Jade and Sass files, as well as a
minified JavaScript file created by the
[RequireJS Optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html). Other files,
such as external JavaScript libs and image files, are also copied to `build/` so
that it contains everything needed to run the interface in a browser. This
directory can then be compressed and used for deployment.

`grunt build:nsidc-dev` and `grunt build:acadis-dev` skip the RequireJS
optimizer step, and do not create a `build/` directory. Instead, the generated
HTML and CSS are kept within `src/`.

The environment defaults to development, to set the environment pass an
environment argument to grunt, for example `grunt build:nsidc
--environment=production`. The CSS generated from the Sass source varies based
on the environment; for production, it will be compressed, otherwise it is more
readable and includes line numbers mapping to the original source files. The
generated HTML also uses the environment to load the appropriate configuration
from `src/conf/`.

## Running the app locally

Run `grunt build:nsidc-dev` or `grunt build:acadis-dev` to generate the
appropriate `src/index.html` file (as well as css files), then
`./run_local_webserver.rb` and open your browser to http://localhost:8081.

To run using the code generated by the RequireJS optimizer (concatenated and
minified js, rather than the standard source), modify
`local_webserver_config.yaml` to use `build/` instead of `src/`.

### External services

The external services used by the search portal are defined in
`local_webserver_config.yaml`. `search_proxies` are the default choice, and
contain endpoints for the services running on `localhost`. `integration_proxies`
and `qa_proxies` are also defined.

To run against services on integration:

```bash
./run_local_webserver.rb 8081 integration_proxies
```

To run against services on qa:

```bash
./run_local_webserver.rb 8081 qa_proxies
```

## Running the acceptance tests locally

Prerequisites

* Firefox
* If using the development VM under Mac OS X,
  [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) is required.

To run the acceptance tests on your machine from the
[development VM](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/dev-vm-search), you will first need
to ssh with X windowing enabled. Instead of connecting with `vagrant ssh`, use
`ssh -X vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222`.

```shell
grunt test:acceptance --project=ade_search --environment=integration
```

`project` can be `ade_search` or `nsidc_search`

`environment` can be `integration`, `qa`, or `staging`.

The URL used by Cucumber is built from `project` and `environment`. To test
against a different URL (like when running the tests locally), specify with a
`--url` flag (`project` must still be specified):

```shell
grunt test:acceptance --url=http://localhost:8081 --project=ade_search
```

## CSS / Sass

* The structure of our [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) code is as follows:
    * `src/sass`
        * `_config_*.scss`
            * contains different variable definitions to separate styles across
              projects built from the common codebase
        * `*_main.scss`
            * imports the configuration and modules for that project
        * `modules/`
            * a Sass module defines the styling for a specific part of the page;
              keeping our code more modular makes it easier to identify places
              where it can be shared across projects, and makes it easier to
              find a particular selector you are interested in modifying or
              investigating
        * `utilities/`
            * our own custom Sass functions; no CSS rules are defined in here
        * `junk/`
            * old, monolithic CSS files converted to Sass syntax still needing
              cleanup (break into smaller parts, put those parts in `modules/`)
* `grunt sass:dev` generates `src/css/acadis-search.css` and
  `src/css/nsidc-search.css`, combining the project-specifc scss and the common
  files into one
* `grunt sass:$PROJECT` generates `tmp/css/$PROJECT-search.css`; this is used by
  `grunt build:$PROJECT` (see the Build section)
* `grunt sass` is configured to compress the generated CSS files and generate
  source maps, allowing tools like the Chrome Inspector to automatically show
  line numbers from the original Sass files
* `grunt scsslint` runs the [scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint)
  tool on the Sass files. It is configured by rules in `config/scss-lint.yml`
  (with additional rules that should be cleaned up in
  `config/scsslint-todo.yml`)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is used to handle cross-browser CSS3
  features with less code in the files we write.
* Using Sass requires some gems which can be installed with `bundle install`.

## Unit tests

Run the unit tests in [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) with `grunt
jasmine`. Test code is located in `spec/`, written in
[Jasmine 1.3](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html) along with
[Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/).

It can helpful for debugging purposes to run the unit tests in a browser. To do
so, follow these steps:

* if you don't already have the file `_SpecRunner.html`, run `grunt test:unit`
  to generate the file
* make sure your port 8081 is open (kill the local webserver if you are
  running it)
* `grunt serve-tests`
* point your browser to
  [localhost:8081/_SpecRunner.html](localhost:8081/_SpecRunner.html)

## JSHint

Run with `grunt jshint`. Run automatically whenever a JavaScript file is changed
with `grunt watch:jshint`.

JSHint is configured in `.jshintrc`, a JSON file containing a list of options
and allowed global variables.

* [Official documentation for JSHint configuration options](http://www.jshint.com/docs/options/)
* [Grunt task for JSHint](http://www.github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint)
* [JSHint in Emacs with flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck)
* [plugins to run JSHint in various editors and IDEs](http://www.jshint.com/install/#plugins)

## Git Hooks

Our build server attempts to build the project with every revision, and it
requires that linters and unit tests pass successfully. To protect yourself from
the embarrasment of breaking the build, git hooks can be set up to run
everything on your local box before you push.

Git hooks are configured in `Gruntfile.js` with the `grunt-githooks`
plugin. Running `grunt githooks` udpates files in your `.git/hooks/` so that the
specific grunt tasks will be run at the given git events. This means if the
githooks task configuration is ever changed, you will need to run `grunt
githooks` again to update your hook scripts (and if a hook is removed the
Gruntfile configuration, you may need to delete the old script from
`.git/hooks/`).

Currently included hooks (and the tasks they run) are:

* `pre-commit`: `scsslint` and `jshint`
* `pre-push`: `jasmine`

## Bootstrap

We are using a customized version of Bootstrap to avoid conflicts with global
NSIDC styles included via SSI. To add to the existing set of styles and scripts
go to Bootstrap's
[customize page](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/customize.html).

To generate the download, first deselect all items in the "Choose components"
and "Select jQuery plugins" sections.

In "Choose components" select the following:

* Base CSS
    * Buttons
* Componets
    * Button groups and dropdowns
    * Alerts
* JS Components
    * Dropdowns

In "Select jQuery plugins" select the following:

* Dropdowns
* Buttons

Replace the `src/contrib/bootstrap/` directory with the contents of the
downloaded zip file. Be sure to update this list of components after each new
download.

## Releases/Changelog

The version in `package.json` is updated automatically with the `grunt
release:$part` task (where `$part` is `patch`, `minor`, or `major`). This task
creates a git tag for the new version, and adds 2 new header lines to
`CHANGELOG.md`, indicating the version number and the date it was
released. Therefore, new changes should be documented at the top of CHANGELOG.md
without a version header, since it will be added automatically later.
